            <p>i created a library management system using JAVA & MYSQL.<br> Imagine going to the library, picking up a book, and simply entering the book into a computer instead of entering your date and book details in a register. Is it simple and convenient? The library management system is here. This system is convenient for people who go to the library to find books, and also for librarians who guide and take care of these things. It ensures that everything works in the order of the system, as everyone who picks up or returns a book must enter a record into the system.</p>

            <p>The library management system is a simple and complete book library system. The system requires different types of JAR files to run smoothly. and so mysql database as backend. The overall system was designed in NetBeans IDE. To run this project, you can use both the NetBeans IDE and the Eclipse IDE, of download the exe file.</p>
