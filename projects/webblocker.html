            <h1>Web-site blocker cross-platform</h1>

            <h5>see the project in <a href="https://github.com/rabah01abellache/website-blocker-using-electron.js">Github</a></h5>

            <p>Electron JS uses web technologies like pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It doesn't require any native skills unless you want to do something more advanced. It can be designed to work with a single browser. Its filesystem belongs to the Node.js API and is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.</p>
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>my application have a simple ui. one text field you enter a website domaine and i use the node api to append that url to the hosts file in the system.same thing for unlocking websites but we are deleting that domain in the hosts file</p>


            <p>Yes, I know there are many easy ways to block websites. Just download a Chrome plugin, or rather software that does this for us. Well, it's easy! But please, we're developers, we don't do these things! When we need something, we write it instead of using some random trick to get the job done... right? !</p>
